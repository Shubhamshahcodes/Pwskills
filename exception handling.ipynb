    "# What is an exception in Python?\n",
    "Imagine you're baking a cake following a recipe. Suddenly, you realize you're out of sugar. That's like an exception in Python. It's when something unexpected happens while your program is running. Maybe you try to divide a number by zero or you try to open a file that doesn't exist. Python raises an exception to tell you, \"Hey, something went wrong!\" It's like a warning sign that lets you handle the problem gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Difference between exception and syntax error:\n",
    "Okay, let's compare it to writing a letter. Syntax errors are like spelling mistakes or grammar errors in your letter. You accidentally write \"hte\" instead of \"the\" or forget a period at the end of a sentence. Python sees these mistakes when it reads your code and says, \"Wait a minute, this doesn't make sense!\" It's like having your English teacher correct your mistakes before you even start reading the letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "But exceptions are different. They're like unexpected things that happen while delivering the letter. Maybe the address is wrong, or the mailbox is full. These are things you couldn't have caught just by looking at the writing. Similarly, in Python, exceptions happen while the program is running, not when you're typing it out. They're like surprises that your program encounters along the way, and you need to handle them properly to keep things running smoothly."

    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it's like ignoring that eggshell in the mixing bowl. Let me explain with an example:\n",

    "\n",

Instead, we should handle the exception gracefully, like picking out the eggshell and continuing to cook.
