    "# Q1. The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "- Mean: It is the average value of a dataset and is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the total number of values.\n",
    "- Median: It is the middle value of a dataset when arranged in ascending order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves.\n",
    "- Mode: It is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. The mean, median, and mode are used to measure the central tendency of a dataset:\n",
    "- Mean: It represents the typical value of the dataset and is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "- Median: It represents the central value of the dataset and is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.\n",
    "- Mode: It represents the most common value in the dataset and is used for categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. For the given height data:\n",
    "[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]\n",
    "- Mean: \\( \\text{Mean} = \\frac{178 + 177 + \\ldots + 176.5}{15} \\)\n",
    "- Median: It is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order.\n",
    "- Mode: It is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. \n",
    "The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the data points around the mean. It indicates how much the data deviates from the mean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread of a dataset:\n",
    "- Range: It is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "- Variance: It measures the average squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: It measures the average deviation from the mean and is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. \n",
    "A Venn diagram is a graphical representation used to illustrate the relationships between sets. It consists of overlapping circles or other shapes, with each circle representing a set and the overlapping areas representing the intersections between the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. For the given sets A = {2,3,4,5,6,7} and B = {0,2,6,8,10}:\n",
    "(i) A ∩ B represents the intersection of sets A and B, which contains the elements common to both sets. In this case, A ∩ B = {2,6}.\n",
    "(ii) A ⋃ B represents the union of sets A and B, which contains all elements from both sets without duplicates. In this case, A ⋃ B = {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8. \n",
    "Skewness in data refers to the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data points. If a dataset is skewed, it means that the distribution is not symmetric around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q9. If a dataset is right-skewed, the median will be positioned to the left of the mean. This is because the presence of higher values (outliers) in the right tail of the distribution pulls the mean towards the higher end, making it greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables but does not provide information about the strength of the relationship. Correlation, on the other hand, measures both the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables. It is standardized, ranging from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. Both covariance and correlation are used in statistical analysis to assess relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. The formula for calculating the sample mean (\\( \\bar{x} \\)) is:\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the sample mean,\n",
    "- \\( x_i \\) are the individual data points,\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the total number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example calculation:\n",
    "Consider the dataset: {10, 15, 20, 25, 30}\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30}{5} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. For a normal distribution:\n",
    "- The mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "- The distribution is symmetric around the mean, with half of the data points falling on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together, whereas correlation measures both the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables. Covariance is not standardized and can take any value, whereas correlation is standardized and ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "- Measures of central tendency like the mean are sensitive to outliers, as they can disproportionately influence the calculated value.\n",
    "- Measures of dispersion like the range, variance, and standard deviation can be distorted by outliers, leading to inaccurate representations of the spread of the data."
