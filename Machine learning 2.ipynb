    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the data as if they are true patterns. This can lead to poor generalization performance on unseen data, as the model fails to capture the underlying relationships and instead memorizes the training examples. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, resulting in high bias and poor performance both on the training and test data. To mitigate overfitting, techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping can be employed. Underfitting can be addressed by using more complex models, increasing the model's capacity, or adding more features to the dataset.\n",

    "Cross-validation: Splitting the data into multiple folds and evaluating the model's performance on each fold to ensure generalization.\n",

    "Feature selection: Removing irrelevant or redundant features from the dataset to reduce model complexity.\n",

    "The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning models. Bias measures the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model, while variance measures the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. High bias models tend to underfit the data, while high variance models tend to overfit the data. Balancing bias and variance is crucial for achieving good generalization performance. As one decreases, the other typically increases, and finding the right balance is essential for optimal model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing training and validation curves: Plotting the model's performance metrics (e.g., loss or accuracy) on both the training and validation datasets over epochs or iterations can help identify overfitting and underfitting.\n",
    "Evaluating performance on a separate test set: Assessing the model's performance on a held-out test set that was not used during training or validation can provide a more unbiased estimate of its generalization performance.\n",
    "Using regularization techniques: Monitoring changes in model weights or coefficients during training, as regularization techniques penalize overly large parameter values that may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "Cross-validation: Splitting the data into multiple folds and evaluating the model's performance on each fold can help detect overfitting by assessing its generalization across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "Q6: Bias and variance are two sources of error in machine learning models that represent different aspects of their performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "High bias models have limited capacity and struggle to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to underfitting. Examples include linear regression models applied to nonlinear data or decision trees with shallow depth.\n",
    "High variance models are overly sensitive to fluctuations in the training data and capture noise instead of true patterns, leading to overfitting. Examples include deep neural networks with many layers or decision trees with high depth.\n",
    "Q7: Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages overly complex models. Common regularization techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization (Lasso): Adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients as a penalty term.\n",
    "L2 regularization (Ridge): Adds the sum of the squared coefficients as a penalty term.\n",
    "Dropout: Randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training to prevent complex co-adaptations of features.\n",
    "Early stopping: Stops the training process when the model's performance on a validation set starts to degrade, preventing it from overfitting to the training data."
