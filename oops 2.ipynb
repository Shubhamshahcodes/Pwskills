    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a notion in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on portraying an object's fundamental characteristics and behaviours while obscuring superfluous information.\n",
    "It enables you to specify the structure and common behaviour of objects without giving their entire implementation by creating abstract classes or interfaces.\n",
    "Abstraction aids in the creation of a high-level perspective of things as well as the simplification of complicated systems by breaking them down into manageable components.\n",
    "Abstraction enables you to build a blueprint for classes that includes only the properties and methods needed for a certain notion, without describing how those attributes and methods are implemented. \n",
    "The concrete subclasses that inherit from the abstract class are responsible for the actual implementation details.\n",
