    "Q1. Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning category. It is based on the idea of creating a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees as the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by training each decision tree on a random subset of the training data and using random feature subsets for splitting at each node. This randomness helps to decorrelate the individual trees in the ensemble, leading to a reduction in variance and improved generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging (for regression tasks) or using voting (for classification tasks) the predictions of individual trees. This aggregation helps to smooth out noise and reduce the impact of outliers, resulting in more stable and accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor include the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators), the maximum depth of each tree (max_depth), the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split), the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node (min_samples_leaf), and the maximum number of features to consider when looking for the best split (max_features), among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor lies in their underlying algorithms. While Random Forest Regressor builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions, Decision Tree Regressor builds a single decision tree based on the entire dataset. Additionally, Random Forest Regressor incorporates randomness in feature selection and bootstrapping, which helps to reduce overfitting compared to Decision Tree Regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Advantages of Random Forest Regressor include its ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality, its resistance to overfitting, and its robustness to noisy data. However, it may be computationally expensive and less interpretable compared to simpler models like linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. The output of Random Forest Regressor is a prediction of the target variable for each input sample. For regression tasks, this prediction is typically a continuous value representing the expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. While Random Forest Regressor is primarily designed for regression tasks, it can also be adapted for classification tasks by using a different variant called Random Forest Classifier. This variant modifies the aggregation method to perform majority voting among the individual decision trees' predictions for classification tasks."
