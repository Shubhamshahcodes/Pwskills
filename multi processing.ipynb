    "# Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to create and run multiple processes concurrently to execute tasks in parallel. Each process has its own memory space, which allows for true parallelism and efficient utilization of multiple CPU cores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful for tasks that are CPU-bound or computationally intensive, as it can significantly reduce the execution time by distributing the workload across multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes concurrently, each with its own memory space, while multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing provides true parallelism, as each process runs independently, while multithreading achieves concurrency by interleaving the execution of threads within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks, as it can take advantage of multiple CPU cores, while multithreading is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks, where threads can perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing has higher memory overhead due to separate memory spaces for each process, while multithreading has lower memory overhead as threads share the same memory space."
