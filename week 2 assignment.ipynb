    "''' Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Python allows you to add comments to your code in order to explain, describe, or temporarily turn off specific lines of code. \n",
    "In Python, there are two categories of comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1]Single-line comments: \n",
    "The # character can be used to create a single-line comment. \n",
    "The interpreter interprets anything put on the same line following the # as a comment and ignores it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2]Docstrings: \n",
    "Multi-line comments, often known as docstrings, are a useful tool for larger comments or documentation strings. \n",
    "Docstrings are multi-line text strings that are encased in triple quotation marks (\"\"\" or '''). \n",

    "''' Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilising built-in methods or constructors intended for type conversion, you may change one data type into another in Python. \n",
    "Here are a few typical techniques for type conversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1]Implicit Conversion (Type Coercion): \n",
    "When it is safe and sensible to do so, Python occasionally automatically executes type conversion. \n",
    "For instance, Python automatically transforms the operands to a common data type when executing arithmetic operations with various data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5  # integer\n",
    "y = 2.5  # float\n",
    "z = x + y  # The addition operation promotes `x` to a float, and `z` becomes a float: 7.5\n",
    "\n",
    "2]Type casting:\n",
    "In other circumstances, you can explicitly convert one data type to another by using the proper constructors or conversion methods. \n",
    "Several frequently used functions for explicit type conversion are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "int(): Converts a value to an integer\n",
    "example:\n",
    "num = \"10\"\n",
    "num_int = int(num)   \"10\" is converted to the integer 10\n",
    "\n",
    "float(): Converts a value to a float.\n",
    "example:\n",
    "num = \"3.14\"\n",
    "num_float = float(num)   \"3.14\" is converted to the float 3.14\n",
    "\n",
    "str(): Converts a value to a string.\n",
    "example:\n",
    "num = 42\n",
    "num_str = str(num)   42 is converted to the string \"42\"\n",
    "\n",
    "list(), tuple(), set(): Converts a sequence or iterable to a list, tuple, or set, respectively.\n",
    "example:\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "my_list = list(my_string)   Converts the string to a list: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\n",
    "my_tuple = tuple(my_string)   Converts the string to a tuple: ('H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')\n",
    "my_set = set(my_string)   Converts the string to a set: {'H', 'e', 'l', 'o'}\n",
    "\n",
    "bool(): Converts a value to a boolean.\n",
    "value = 0\n",
    "value_bool = bool(value)  # 0 is converted to False\n",
    "\n",
