    "The decision tree classifier algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the features that best separate the target variable classes.\n",

    "# Q2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves selecting the best feature and threshold to split the data at each node to maximize information gain or minimize impurity, often measured using metrics like Gini impurity or entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary classification problem, a decision tree classifier creates a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents the class label. The goal is to iteratively split the data into subsets until each subset contains only one class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. \n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, decision tree classification divides the feature space into regions, where each region corresponds to a different class label. The decision boundaries are orthogonal to the feature axes and aligned with the splits in the decision tree, making predictions based on which region a new data point falls into.\n",

    "# Q5. \n",

    "The confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted labels to actual labels. It consists of four metrics: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN)."

    "Q7. Choosing an appropriate evaluation metric depends on the specific goals and requirements of the classification problem. For example, precision is suitable when minimizing false positives is crucial, while recall is important when minimizing false negatives is a priority. Understanding the trade-offs between different metrics helps in selecting the most relevant one.\n",
