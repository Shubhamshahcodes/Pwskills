    "Q2\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is built on four pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the combination of data (attributes) and methods (behaviours) that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. \n",
    "It hides the class's internal implementation details from the outside world and just exposes the essential interfaces for interaction. \n",
    "Encapsulation allows data to be accessed and updated via techniques, allowing for more control over data access and maintaining data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: \n",
    "Abstraction focuses on conveying an object's fundamental traits and behaviours while obscuring superfluous information. \n",
    "It enables you to specify the structure and common behaviour of objects without giving their entire implementation by creating abstract classes or interfaces. \n",
    "Abstraction aids in the creation of a high-level perspective of things as well as the simplification of complicated systems by breaking them down into manageable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a method that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviours from another class (superclass or base class).\n",
    "The features of the superclass can be extended or overridden by the subclass. \n",
    "Inheritance encourages code reuse and aids in the development of a class hierarchy in which common characteristics and functions are declared in a base class and reused by several subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism refers to the presence of numerous forms. \n",
    "Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of various classes to be considered as objects of the same base class. \n",
    "It enables a single interface to represent many data kinds, allowing for consistent interaction with objects of various classes. \n",
    "Method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) can be used to accomplish polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "By organising data and behaviour into objects and giving a clear framework for code organisation and reuse, these four pillars constitute the core of Object-Oriented Programming, allowing the construction of modular, manageable, and extensible software systems.\n",

    "Instance Method Access: \n",
    "Instance methods can use self to access and act on the attributes and other methods of the class's unique instance (object). \n",
